## Description

[SWAG (Secure Web-server And Gateway)](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-swag) sets up an NGINX webserver and reverse proxy with PHP support and a built-in swag client that automates free SSL server certificate generation and renewal processes. It also contains fail2ban for intrusion prevention.

## Install/Setup

### LinuxServer's SWAG Starter Guide

[Official Guide](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/swag)

If this is your first time learning about NGINX, proxies, or and Let's Encrypt, we highly recommend you read over the official guide for the container.

### General Setup

Out of the box, the SWAG container created by [linuxserver.io](https://www.linuxserver.io/) performs reverse proxy functions using [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) and automatic https encrypted connections using certificates provided by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

To configure your reverse proxy, consider if you want to use subfolders (ie. domain.com/portainer) or subdomains (ie. portainer.domain.com). Subdomains will take more configuration, as DNS entries and certificate subject alternate names are required.

The first thing to setup is your domain and email settings in `.docker/compose/.env` under `SWAG`. Set the `SWAG_EMAIL` and `SWAG_URL`. If using subdomains ensure to add each subdomain to `SWAG_SUBDOMAINS` as each subdomain prefix (e.g. `SWAG_SUBDOMAINS=portainer,deluge,pihole`.

There are a number of sample proxy configuration files found in `~/.config/appdata/swag/nginx/proxy-confs/` and in most cases will just need the .sample removed from the filename. Currently not every applicable app has an example configuration and are still being tested.

Subfolder Example:

```bash
cp ~/.config/appdata/swag/nginx/proxy-confs/portainer.subfolder.conf.sample ~/.config/appdata/swag/nginx/proxy-confs/portainer.subfolder.conf
```

This will make Portainer available at `domain.com/portainer`

Subdomain Example:

```bash
cp ~/.config/appdata/swag/nginx/proxy-confs/portainer.subdomain.conf.sample ~/.config/appdata/swag/nginx/proxy-confs/portainer.subdomain.conf
```

and will enable the service at `portainer.domain.com`

Each time you change a proxy conf file you will need to restart the Swag container:

```bash
docker restart swag
```
