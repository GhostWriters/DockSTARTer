## Description

[FileFlows](https://fileflows.com/) lets you design, schedule, and run automated file processing pipelines with ease — from a single server to a distributed cluster. Perfect for self-hosted environments, home labs, and cloud deployments. Use the interface in multiple languages.

Build powerful automated flows for video transcoding, audio processing, images, ebooks, comics, and more. Supports AV1, HEVC, H.264 with hardware acceleration (Intel QSV, NVIDIA NVENC, AMD AMF, VAAPI, VideoToolbox on Mac) and VMAF-guided optimization. Automatically process videos: crop black bars, upscale/downscale, remove/convert audio tracks, remux containers, burn-in subtitles, or watermark content.
