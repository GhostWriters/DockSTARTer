To give Portainer the ability to go directly to your IP name of your server

Log onto your Portainer server and then select Settings > Endpoints > your local endpoint (mine was primary) > and change "Public IP" it'll update those links to work put whatever IP you want to use in the link eg: 192.168.1.X
