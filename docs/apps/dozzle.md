## Description

[Dozzle](https://dozzle.dev/) is a simple, lightweight application that provides you with a web based interface to monitor your Docker container logs live. It doesnâ€™t store log information, it is for live monitoring of your container logs only.

## Install/Setup

### Dozzle's Security

Dozzle **doesn't support** authentication out of the box.

We **do not** recommend you expose dozzle to the outside world without some sort of protection in front of it such as [Organizr's Server Auth](https://docs.organizr.app/books/setup-features/page/serverauth).
