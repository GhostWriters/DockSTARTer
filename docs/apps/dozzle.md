## Description

[Dozzle](https://dozzle.dev/) is a simple, lightweight application that provides
you with a web based interface to monitor your Docker container logs live. It
doesn’t store log information, it is for live monitoring of your container logs
only.

## Install/Setup

This application does not have any specific setup instructions documented. If
you need assistance setting up this application please visit our
[support page](https://dockstarter.com/basics/support/).

### Dozzle's Security

Dozzle **doesn't support** authentication out of the box.

We **do not** recommend you expose dozzle to the outside world without some sort
of protection in front of it such as
[Organizr's Server Auth](https://docs.organizr.app/books/setup-features/page/serverauth).
