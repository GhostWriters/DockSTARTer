# Beets

[Beets](http://beets.io/) is a music library manager and not, for the most part, a music player. It does include a simple player plugin and an experimental Web-based player, but it generally leaves actual sound-reproduction to specialized tools.

The GIT Repository for Beets is located at [https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-beets](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-beets)
