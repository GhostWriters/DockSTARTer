## Description

Unpackerr runs as a daemon on your download host. It checks for completed
downloads and extracts them so Radarr, Lidarr, Sonarr, and Readarr may import
them. There are a handful of options out there for extracting and deleting files
after your client downloads them. I just didn't care for any of them, so I wrote
my own. I wanted a small single-binary with reasonable logging that can extract
downloaded archives and clean up the mess after they've been imported.
