## Description

[HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/) is a tool for converting video from nearly
any format to a selection of modern, widely supported codecs. The GUI of the
application is accessed through a modern web browser (no installation or
configuration needed on client side) or via any VNC client. A fully automated
mode is also available: drop files into a watch folder and let HandBrake process
them without any user interaction.

## Install/Setup

This application does not have any specific setup instructions documented. If
