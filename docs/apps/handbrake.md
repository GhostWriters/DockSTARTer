# HandBrake

[HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/) is a tool for converting video from nearly any format to a selection of modern, widely supported codecs. The GUI of the application is accessed through a modern web browser (no installation or configuration needed on client side) or via any VNC client. A fully automated mode is also available: drop files into a watch folder and let HandBrake process them without any user interaction.

The GIT Repository for HandBrake is located at [https://github.com/jlesage/docker-handbrake](https://github.com/jlesage/docker-handbrake).
