## Description

[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/): The World's Most Advanced Open Source Relational Database

## Install/Setup

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

There is a wealth of information to be found describing how to [install](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and [use](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/) PostgreSQL through the [official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/). The [open source community](https://www.postgresql.org/community/) provides many helpful places to become familiar with PostgreSQL, discover how it works.

We **heavily** recommend that if you spin up a container that requires a database you create a user for that container. You should **NEVER** use the root account for anything other than database management.
