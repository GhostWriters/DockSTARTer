## Description

[Speedtest Tracker](https://github.com/henrywhitaker3/Speedtest-Tracker) runs a speedtest check every hour and graphs the results. The back-end is written in `Laravel` and the front-end uses `React`. It uses the Ookla's Speedtest cli package to get the data and uses `Chart.js` to plot the results.

This program can also be used a home page item in [Organizr](https://organizr.app).

A demo is available [here](https://speedtest.henrywhitaker.com).

*Disclaimer: You will need to accept Ookla's EULA and privacy agreements in order to use this container.*

## Install/Setup

### Base Path

You can set a base path for this application if you want to host it behind a reverse proxy. By default it binds to `/`, but you can change the variable called `SPEEDTEST_BASE_PATH` in your `.env` file to whatever you want and run `ds -c up speedtest` afterwards.

As usual, we **strongly discourage** having this application be public facing without some sort of protection in front of it, such as [Organizr's Server Auth](https://docs.organizr.app/books/setup-features/page/serverauth).

### Notifications

This application supports notifications to some of the most popular services such as Telegram and Discord. Both of these services can be configured either using the application's Web GUI or environment variables through an [override](https://dockstarter.com/overrides/introduction).
