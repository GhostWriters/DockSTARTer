Ldap-auth software is for authenticating users who request protected resources
from servers proxied by nginx. It includes a daemon (ldap-auth) that
communicates with an authentication server, and a webserver daemon that
generates an authentication cookie based on the userâ€™s credentials. The daemons
are written in Python for use with a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP) authentication server (OpenLDAP or Microsoft Windows Active Directory
2003 and 2012).
