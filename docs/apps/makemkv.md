## Description

[MakeMKV](http://www.makemkv.com/) is your one-click solution to convert video
that you own into free and patents-unencumbered format that can be played
everywhere. MakeMKV is a format converter, otherwise called "transcoder". It
converts the video clips from proprietary (and usually encrypted) disc into a
set of MKV files, preserving most information but not changing it in any way.
The MKV format can store multiple video/audio tracks with all meta-information
and preserve chapters. There are many players that can play MKV files nearly on
all platforms, and there are tools to convert MKV files to many formats,
including DVD and Blu-ray discs.
