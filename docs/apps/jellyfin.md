## Description

[Jellyfin](http://jellyfin.org/) is a free software media system that puts you
in control of managing and streaming your media. It is an alternative to the
proprietary Emby and Plex, to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user
devices via multiple apps. Jellyfin is descended from Emby's 3.5.2 release and
ported to the .NET Core framework to enable full cross-platform support. There
are no strings attached, no premium licenses or features, and no hidden agendas:
just a team who wants to build something better and work together to achieve it.

## Install/Setup

This application does not have any specific setup instructions documented. If
