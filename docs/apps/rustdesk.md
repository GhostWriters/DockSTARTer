## Description

[RustDesk](https://rustdesk.com) is an open-source, self-hosted TeamViewer alternative.

This uses the "S6-overlay based image" for RustDesk which ships both hbbs and hbbr in a single container.

hbbs is the RustDesk ID/Rendezvous server. hbbr is the RustDesk relay server. Both are needed for a functional RustDesk deployment.

When hbbs is first run, it will generate a public/private keypair for the clients to use. You can see this take place in the logs:

```
INFO [src/common.rs:133] Private/public key written to id_ed25519/id_ed25519.pub
```

You can view the contents of this key by browsing to your config folder, for instance, `~/.config/appdata/rustdesk`.
