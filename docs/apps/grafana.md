## Description

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is an open-source platform for monitoring and
observability. Grafana allows you to query, visualize, alert on and understand
your metrics no matter where they are stored.

## Install/Setup

When installing the Grafana container, the installer will install under the
`appdata` directory as the root user and you will see errors as such:

> mkdir: cannot create directory '/var/lib/grafana/plugins': Permission denied, GF_PATHS_DATA='/var/lib/grafana' is not writable.

However once it is installed you can change the owner/group of it to whatever is
required. Run the following command to fix it:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/.config/appdata/grafana
```

Restart your container by running:

```bash
docker restart grafana
```
