## Description

[Apcupsd]((http://www.apcupsd.org/)) is a dockerized Python script that will send data from apcupsd to influxdb. You can then visualize the influxdb data in [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)/[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).

## Install/Setup

First you need to install `apcupsd` on your host. The command will vary depending on what Linux OS you are using. After you install `apcupsd` on your host, there are some changes that need to take place in your `apcupsd.conf` file. Again, the location of this file varies by OS, however, for Ubuntu based systems you can find this file in `/etc/apcupsd/`.

By default `acpupsd` it is set to listen on `127.0.0.1`. DockSTARTer (DS) does not run containers on `host` mode so your container will not be able to communicate with your `apcupsd` service. You need to open the `apcupsd.conf` file and search for `NISIP`. You need to change the IP address listed there to your local IP. Once you do this, you need to restart your `apcupsd` service so new settings take place.

The docker image DS uses makes uses of `NOMPOWER` on your UPS. If your UPS **does not have** `NOMPOWER`, you will need to add an [override](https://dockstarter.com/overrides/introduction/) to your existing DS installation and set a new environment variable called `WATTS` under `environment` which will need to equal the rated max power for your UPS, e.g: `1000`. To find whether your UPS has `NOMPOWER` or not, you can run `apcaccess | grep "NOMPOWER"`.
