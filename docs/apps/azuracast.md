## Description

[AzuraCast](https://azuracast.com/) is a free and open-source self-hosted web radio management suite that includes the full suite of software needed to build, manage and broadcast a web radio station. Out of the box, it includes a rich web interface, an AutoDJ powered by Liquidsoap, and Icecast to serve broadcasts to listeners.

## Install/Setup

After your first setup, you can continue the setup process by visiting your server's public-facing IP address at the port(s) configured for AzuraCast to listen to.

By default, station storage, asset uploads, and backups are stored in your configured storage location. It is recommended to take advantage of the internal backup function before making major changes to your station or upgrading the software to the latest version.
