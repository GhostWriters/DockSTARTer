## Description

[SABnzbd](http://sabnzbd.org/) makes Usenet as simple and streamlined as possible by automating everything we can. All you have to do is add an `.nzb.` and SABnzbd takes over from there, where it will be automatically downloaded, verified, repaired, extracted and filed away with zero human interaction.
