## Description

[SABnzbd](http://sabnzbd.org/) makes Usenet as simple and streamlined as
possible by automating everything we can. All you have to do is add an `.nzb.`
and SABnzbd takes over from there, where it will be automatically downloaded,
verified, repaired, extracted and filed away with zero human interaction.

## Install/Setup

This application does not have any specific setup instructions documented. If
