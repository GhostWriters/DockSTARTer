## Description

[Rsnapshot](http://www.rsnapshot.org/) is a filesystem snapshot utility based on
rsync. rsnapshot makes it easy to make periodic snapshots of local machines, and
remote machines over ssh. The code makes extensive use of hard links whenever
possible, to greatly reduce the disk space required.
