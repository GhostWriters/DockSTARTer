## Install/Setup

### rTorrentVPN WebUI Access

If you're attempting to get access to the rTorrentVPN WebUI remotely outside of your home network, you are going to have to do this through a reverse proxy using [SWAG](https://dockstarter.com/apps/swag/). Full details and steps are outlined here [VPN Information](https://dockstarter.com/advanced/vpn-info/).

The sample proxy configuration files found in `~/.config/appdata/swag/nginx/proxy-confs/` will need to be modified and as usual, have the .sample removed from the filename.

You will need to edit the appropriate proxy `.conf`. Enter either `sudo nano rutorrent.subfolder.conf` or `sudo nano rutorrent.subdomain.conf` depending on your configuration desires and change the below lines. NOTE: There will be multiple lines that need to be changed.

Original

```nginx
set $upstream_app rutorrent;
set $upstream_port 80;
```

Modified

```nginx
set $upstream_app rtorrentvpn;
set $upstream_port 9080;
```

Save the file and restart your container by running:

```bash
docker restart swag
```
