## Description

[Plex](https://plex.tv/) organizes video, music and photos from personal media libraries and streams them to smart TVs, streaming boxes and mobile devices. This container is packaged as a standalone Plex Media Server. has always been a top priority. Straightforward design and bulk actions mean getting things done faster.

## Install/Setup

### Common Issue: Playback fails for certain media

One possible resolution to this issue is to remove the codecs folder:

```bash
rm -rf "~/.config/appdata/plex/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Codecs"
```

Or place a custom init script in your config (ex: `~/.config/appdata/plex/custom-cont-init.d/00-plex-remove-codecs`):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/with-contenv bash
set -euo pipefail
IFS=$'\n\t'

rm -rf "/config/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Codecs"
echo "Codecs removed."
```

This will run every time the container restarts.

### Common Issue: Cannot Claim Server on First Run

If you are starting the Plex container for the first time and cannot claim your server to set it up there are 3 methods you can try to resolve the issue:

#### 1. Set the PLEX_CLAIM variable

```bash
docker stop plex
docker rm plex
```

```bash
# removes the config folder for plex
# !WARNING! do NOT do this if you have already setup your plex server and are having issues connecting to it, skip to option 3 instead
rm -rf ~/.config/appdata/plex
```

```bash
sudo nano ~/.docker/compose/.env
# with the nano file editor open locate the PLEX_CLAIM variable
# go to https://www.plex.tv/claim/ in your browser and get the claim token set your PLEX_CLAIM variable
# the token expires in 5 minutes, so we'll want to get the rest done quickly
# ctrl+x to save and exit nano
```

```bash
ds -c up plex
```

Then try again to claim the server by visiting `http://yourserverip:32400/web/index.html`

#### 2. Host Network Mode

If the first method does not work, edit your `.env` and set `PLEX_NETWORK_MODE=host`. Run `ds -c` and then attempt to claim your server. After claiming your server set `PLEX_NETWORK_MODE=` (back to blank).

#### 3. Claim helper script

If the first and second methods both have not worked this script should make it happen.

```bash
docker exec -it plex /bin/bash
```

```bash
# download the script
curl -L -o plex-claim-server.sh https://github.com/uglymagoo/plex-claim-server/raw/master/plex-claim-server.sh
```

```bash
# make the script executable
chmod +x plex-claim-server.sh
```

```bash
# go to https://www.plex.tv/claim/ in your browser and get the claim token and replace PLEX_CLAIM with this token in the next command, please use use the double quotes around your claim token
./plex-claim-server.sh "PLEX_CLAIM"
```

```bash
# fix permissions
chown abc:abc "/config/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Preferences.xml"
```

```bash
# leave the container
exit
```

```bash
docker restart plex
```

### How To Run Plex Different Pass Versions

Edit `~/.docker/compose/.env` and set:

```bash
PLEX_VERSION=plexpass
```

Then run:

```bash
ds -c up plex
```

### Rebuilding From Scratch

Thankfully, some of this information is well documented (but not easily found) over on Plex's website here!

- Moving an installation to another system: [https://support.plex.tv/articles/201370363-move-an-install-to-another-system/](https://support.plex.tv/articles/201370363-move-an-install-to-another-system/)
- Where is the Plex Media Server data directory? [https://support.plex.tv/articles/202915258-where-is-the-plex-media-server-data-directory-located/](https://support.plex.tv/articles/202915258-where-is-the-plex-media-server-data-directory-located/)

### Hardware Transcoding

If you would like to have Plex use a GPU that is attached to your DockSTARTer host, you can do this using an [override](https://dockstarter.com/overrides/introduction/) like so:

```yaml
  plex:
    devices:
      - /dev/dri:/dev/dri
```
