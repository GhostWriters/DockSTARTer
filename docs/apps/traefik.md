## Description

[Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy.

## Install/Setup

This container itself is quite simple but note that lots of customization will be needed for the client apps you will be routing with Traefik. You'll need to use [DockSTARTer overrides](https://dockstarter.com/overrides/introduction/), more specifically editing `docker-compose.override.yml` to add labels, etc, to your client apps to configure Traefik routing.

### traefik.yml

You can configure Traefik itself with a `traefik.yml` file. You should create this at `${DOCKERCONFDIR}/traefik` which is by default volume mapped to `/etc/traefik` inside the container.
