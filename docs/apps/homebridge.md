## Description

[Homebridge](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge) is a lightweight NodeJS server you can run on your
home network that emulates the iOS HomeKit API. It supports Plugins, which are community-contributed
modules that provide a basic bridge from HomeKit to various 3rd-party APIs provided by manufacturers
of "smart home" devices.
