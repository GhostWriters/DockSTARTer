## Description

[Homer](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer) is a dead simple static HOMepage for your servER to keep your services on hand, from a simple yaml configuration file.

## Install/Setup

Be sure to read the [app specific documentation](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer) on github as the environment variables below are an extension of those explained in the documentation.

Note that your configuration files and homer assets are located in `${DOCKERCONFDIR}/homer`

### Environment Variables

#### HOMER\_INIT_ASSETS

`1` (default) Install example configuration file & assets (favicons, ...) to help you get started.

`0` Don't install assets. Use existing files. This is the suggested value after you first launch homer and assets are installed.

#### HOMER_SUBFOLDER

(default: `''`) If you would like to host Homer in a subfolder, (ex: http://my-domain/homer), set this to the subfolder path (ex /homer).
