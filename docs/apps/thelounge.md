## Description

[TheLounge](https://thelounge.chat/) is a web IRC client that you host on your
own server.

## Install/Setup

* When the application first runs, it will populate its `/config`
* Stop the container
* Now from the host, edit `~/.config/appdata/thelounge/config.js`, or wherever you've mapped it
* In most cases you want the value `public: false` to allow named users only
  * This will allow for persistant connections to the servers you configure for each account
* Setting the two prefetch values to `true` improves usability, but uses more storage
* Once you have the configuration you want, save it and start the container again
* For each user, run the command
* `docker exec -it thelounge s6-setuidgid abc thelounge add <user>`
* You will be prompted to enter a password that will not be echoed.
* Saving logs to disk is the default, this consumes more space but allows scrollback.
* To log in to the application, browse to `http://<hostip>:9000`
* Other containerized applications such as organizr would use `http://<container>:9000`
* You should now be prompted for a username and password on the webinterface.
* Once logged in, you can add an IRC network. Some defaults are preset for Freenode.
