## Description

[Tdarr](https://github.com/haveagitgat/tdarr) is a self hosted web-app for automating media library transcode/remux management and making sure your files are exactly how you need them to be in terms of codecs/streams/containers etc. Designed to work alongside Sonarr/Radarr and built with the aim of modularisation, parallelisation and scalability, each library you add has its own transcode settings, filters and schedule. Workers can be fired up and closed down as necessary, and are split into 3 types - 'general', 'transcode' and 'health check'. Worker limits can be managed by the scheduler as well as manually.

## Install/Setup

### Common Errors

If you start up the container for the first time and can't get the UI to load please check the logs by running:

```yml
docker logs tdarr
```

If you see the following error on the console:

>* Starting database mongodb
> ...fail

Permissions are likely not set correctly on your `TDARR_DB` variable location, run the following:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /path/to/location
```
