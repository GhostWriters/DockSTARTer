## Description

[xTeVe](https://xteve.de/) is a M3U proxy server for Plex, Emby and any client
and provider which supports the .TS and .M3U8 (HLS) streaming formats. xTeVe
emulates a SiliconDust HDHomeRun OTA tuner, which allows it to expose IPTV style
channels to software, which would not normally support it.
