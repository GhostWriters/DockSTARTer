## Description

[Resilio-sync](https://www.resilio.com) (formerly BitTorrent Sync) uses the
BitTorrent protocol to sync files and folders between all of your devices. There
are both free and paid versions, this container supports both. There is an
official sync image but we created this one as it supports user mapping to
simplify permissions for volumes.

## Install/Setup
