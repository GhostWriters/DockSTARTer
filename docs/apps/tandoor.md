## Description

[Tandoor](https://docs.tandoor.dev/) is a recipe manager and so much more.
You can import recipes from thousands of websites, generate mealplans, manage your shopping list.
Share and collaborate with your friends and family using a mobile friendly web interface.

## Install/Setup

This application has extensive customization options, most docker env variables are documented in the [.env.template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vabene1111/recipes/master/.env.template)
If you run into any issues, enable debug mode to collect logs before opening a ticket.

The application requires a secret key for cryptographic signing. It can be any string, but it is recommend to generate a random string.
On linux you can run `tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 </dev/urandom | head -c 32; echo` to generate a random 32 character string.

### Running with PostgreSQL

It is highly recommended to use this application with a PostgreSQL database.
To setup with postgres, after installing a postgres server (or enabling the DockSTARTer app) create a database and edit .env to use postgres instead of sqlite.
`TANDOOR_DATABASE_URL='postgresql://<postgres_user>:<postgres_password>@<postgres_host>/<tandoor_db>:5432`

Optionally, make tandoor dependent on the postgres container

```yaml
tandoor:
  depends_on:
    - postgres_host
```

### Running with SWAG

It is also highly recommended to serve media files with a web server. If you are already using SWAG you can use nginx to accomplish this.
Set GUNICORN_MEDIA to 0 and edit the docker-compose.override.yml similar to below.

```yaml
swag:
  volumes:
    - ${DOCKER_VOLUME_CONFIG}/recipes/mediafiles:/media
```

Copy `swag/nginx/proxy-confs/recipes.subdomain.conf.sample` to recipes.subdomain.conf editing as necessary to match your setup and restart swag.
