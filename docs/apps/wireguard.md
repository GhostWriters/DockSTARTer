## Description

[WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) is an extremely simple yet fast and
modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster,
simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPsec, while avoiding the massive
headache. It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard
is designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and
super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances. Initially released
for the Linux kernel, it is now cross-platform (Windows, macOS, BSD, iOS,
Android) and widely deployable. It is currently under heavy development, but
already it might be regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest
VPN solution in the industry.
