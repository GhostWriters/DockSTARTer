## Description

This container contains [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/) and [Transmission](https://www.transmissionbt.com/) with a configuration where Transmission is running only when OpenVPN has an active tunnel. It bundles configuration files for many popular VPN providers to make the setup easier.

## Install/Setup
