## Description

[cross-seed](https://www.cross-seed.org/) can inject the torrents it finds directly into your torrent client.
Currently, the supported clients are

- rTorrent
- qBittorrent
- Transmission
- Deluge

If your client isn't supported, `cross-seed` will download a bunch of torrent
files to a folder you specify. After that, I recommend using
[AutoTorrent2](https://github.com/JohnDoee/autotorrent2) to do the last-mile
delivery into your client.

## Install/Setup
