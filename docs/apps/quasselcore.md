## Description

[Quassel-core](http://quassel-irc.org/) is a modern, cross-platform, distributed
IRC client, meaning that one/multiple client(s) can attach to and detach from a
central core.

This container handles the IRC connection (quasselcore) and requires a desktop
client (quasselclient) to be used and configured. It is designed to be always on
and will keep your identity present in IRC even when your clients cannot be
online. Backlog (history) is downloaded by your client upon reconnection
allowing infinite scrollback through time.
