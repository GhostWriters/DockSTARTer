## Description

[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) gives you access to all your files wherever
you are.

## Install/Setup

When you first set up Nextcloud and navigate to `http://<ip>:444` you will be
presented with a login screen. This login screen will have the following
warning:

> Performance warning You chose SQLite as database. SQLite should only be used for minimal and development instances. For production we recommend a different database backend. If you use clients for file syncing, the use of SQLite is highly discouraged.

From there you can click on the dropdown next to `Storage & database` and you
will have 3 options, `SQLite`, `MySQL/MariaDB` and `PostgreSQL`. Pick whichever
database driver you like to work with and fill in the necessary fields. Keep in
mind that whatever database driver you pick will need to already be installed
and/or configured.

### Configuring Nextcloud

If you are running the DockSTARTer Nextcloud container behind a
[SWAG](https://dockstarter.com/apps/swag/) reverse proxy, you may need to add a
extra line to the NextCloud config.php file so it can find it.

Without configuring this you will be able to access the web page, but apps may
timeout or return an invalid password.

Run the below command and add the line to the the config.php file before the
`);`

```bash
nano /config/www/nextcloud/config/config.php
```

Copy the following line: `'overwritehost' => 'hostname',`

Where your `hostname` is the URL you use to access your NextCloud web interface,
**make sure you include the comma at the end**.

Doing this will allow the apps to pass the username/password through to the
application.
