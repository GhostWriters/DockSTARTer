## Description

[autobrr](https://github.com/autobrr/autobrr) is the modern download automation tool for torrents and usenet. With inspiration and ideas from tools like trackarr, autodl-irssi and flexget we built one tool that can do it all, and then some.

## Install/Setup

When installing the autobrr container, the installer will install under the
`appdata` directory as the root user and you will see errors as such:

> error creating file: "open /config/config.toml: permission denied"

However once it is installed you can change the owner/group of it to whatever is
required. Run the following command to fix it:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/.config/appdata/autobrr
```

Restart your container by running:

```bash
docker restart autobrr
```

For other issues please refer to the container [Application Setup](https://autobrr.com/installation/docker) documentation.
