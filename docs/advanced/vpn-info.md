# VPN Info

## VPN Services available to use through DockSTARTer

VPN use is only available where we have found a easily configured container that runs as its own self contained unit.

- DelugeVPN
- qBittorrentVPN
- rTorrentVPN
- SABnzbdVPN
- TransmissionVPN

## VPN tun driver

The VPN containers require an adjustment to your host system:

```bash
echo "iptable_mangle" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/iptable_mangle.conf
echo "tun" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/tun.conf
sudo reboot
```

## Access VPN containers remotely

If you're attempting to access the Web UI for one of your VPN containers (e.g. TransmissionVPN, DelugeVPN, etc.) from outside of your home network using [SWAG](https://dockstarter.com/apps/swag/), you will need to modify the [SWAG](https://dockstarter.com/apps/swag/) configuration file to support the name difference. The sample configs are controlled by [LSIO](https://www.linuxserver.io/), not by DockSTARTer. So this change is required to get the VPN containers running remotely.

The sample proxy configuration files found in `~/.config/appdata/swag/nginx/proxy-confs/` will need to be modified and as usual, have the .sample removed from the filename.

You will also need to edit the appropriate proxy `.conf`. The below example uses the TransmissionVPN container as an example:

Enter either `sudo nano transmission.subfolder.conf` or `sudo nano transmission.subdomain.conf` depending on your configuration desires and change the below line:

Original

```nginx
set $upstream_app transmission;
```

Modified

```nginx
set $upstream_app transmissionvpn;
```

Save the file out and then restart your containers with a `ds -c` command.

## Use a VPN for _everything_

If you require VPN on all connections it is recommended to install OpenVPN as you normally would ( in `/etc/openvpn` etc etc) and then have the Docker service started and stopped by the up / down scripts.

You can disable auto starting of the containers by disabling the docker service. An example provided by a user in our community for Ubuntu:

`sudo systemctl disable docker`

vpnup.sh

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [[ -L "/sbin/init" ]]; then
    systemctl start docker
else
    /etc/init.d/docker start
fi
```

vpndown.sh

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [[ -L "/sbin/init" ]]; then
    systemctl stop docker
else
    /etc/init.d/docker stop
fi
```

If you make changes to your `.env` file you will need to run `ds -c`. If you stop the OpenVPN service, thereby stopping Docker, DockSTARTER might fail. Start your OpenVPN service and run `ds -c` again if it didn't work.

## PIA with Transmission

For PIA VPN Configuration:
These pages come in handy -

- [https://github.com/haugene/docker-transmission-openvpn/blob/master/README.md#network-configuration-options](https://github.com/haugene/docker-transmission-openvpn/blob/master/README.md#network-configuration-options)

If you run into slow VPN issues, it may be the container is using a default .ovpn config. So you'd use something like this with [Overrides / Introduction](https://dockstarter.com/overrides/introduction): `OPENVPN_CONFIG=UK Southampton` depending on your region/location.
