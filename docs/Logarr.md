Logarr configuration has sharing to the logs enabled by default. From within the Logarr container, this is accessible via the /var/log/logarrlogs path. Which is mapped to your ~/.docker/config path of your host machine.

For Logarr you will need to edit the config.php file to point to the correct log files. This file is located in the ~/.docker/config/logarr/www/logarr/assets/ folder of your host machine.


Edit the included config to change these lines:
```
    "Sonarr" => '/var/log/logarrlogs//sonarr/logs/sonarr.txt',

    "Radarr" => '/var/log/logarrlogs/radarr/logs/radarr.txt',

```
