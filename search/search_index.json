However, if you feel comfortable with Linux and want to continue down this route you will need to ensure the following:</p> <ul> <li>You have installed all the necessary updates that are pending in your system.</li> <li>You have set a DNS server in your Web GUI.</li> <li>You have created a user with a home directory outside of the system disk that has <code>sudo</code> and <code>ssh</code> permissions. See below in how to do that.</li> <li>You have a secondary disk other than the system drive mounted and formatted to anything other than NTFS.</li> <li>We recommend you set up a specific \"Shared Folder\" for your home directory. <code>appdata</code> directory should only be used to store container configurations, not home directories.</li> </ul> <p>SSH to your host as root.

You will need to remove that string. Save the file and per OMV documentation you need to run <code>omv-salt deploy run fstab</code>. To verify that the <code>noexec</code> flag was removed from your drive run <code>cat /proc/mounts</code> and find your drive on the list. You can also run <code>cat /proc/mounts | grep partial_drive_name</code>. If the <code>noexec</code> flag is present, you skipped a step.</p> <p>We are now going to work on creating the directories for DS to use.
