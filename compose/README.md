## Files from the repository

These should not be modified! `ds -u` will reset these files.

- `.apps` folder contains yml files that are used as templates for DockSTARTer to piece together your main `docker-compose.yml` file
- `.env.example` file contains the default variables and values for new installs

## Files generated for your system

- `.env` file contains your personalized variables and values that are set via the GUI or by editing the file directly (run `ds -c` after editing)
- `docker-compose.yml` file contains the yml that DockSTARTer creates for you based on your `.env` variables (this is overwritten every time DockSTARTer runs compose and should not be manually modified)
- `docker-compose.override.yml` (optional) file contains the yml that you may manually define to take priority over the yml defined in `docker-compose.yml` generated by DockSTARTer
