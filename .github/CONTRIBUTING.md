# Contributing Guidelines

All code in this repository should be neat and tidy.

More important than being beautiful is being functional. This repository is primarily shell scripts and YAML files.

## Shell scripts

- Remeber [Shell Scripts Matter](https://dev.to/thiht/shell-scripts-matter)
- [Use the Unofficial Bash Strict Mode](http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/)
- Follow the [Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shell.xml)
- Use [Defensive BASH Programming](https://web.archive.org/web/20180917174959/http://www.kfirlavi.com/blog/2012/11/14/defensive-bash-programming/)
- Should be validated using the following tools (recommended to be installed locally):
  - [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck)
  - [shfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh)

## YAML files

- Should be formatted with [https://prettier.io/](https://prettier.io/)
- Should be sorted alphabetically
- Are separated into multiple files:
  - `<appname>.yml` is the main YAML template for an app and should have elements in the following order:
    - `container_name` should match `<appname>`
    - `environment` should contain the environment variables used by the app
      - `- TZ=${TZ}` is always included even if not needed unless some other form of timezone variable is used
    - `labels` should contain the labels used by the app. `appvars` should be lowercase in the labels file and are converted to uppercase automatically to become variables in `.env`. The values in the labels file become the default values in `.env`
      - `com.dockstarter.appinfo.deprecated: "<true|false>"` indicates if an app is deprecated
      - `com.dockstarter.appinfo.description: "<Description>"` will show the description in the menus
      - `com.dockstarter.appinfo.nicename: "<AppName>"` must match `<appname>` exactly but can have mixed case. Ex: Portainer vs PORTAINER
      - `com.dockstarter.appvars.<appname>_enabled: "false"` must be included and default to false. Users pick which apps are enabled
      - `com.dockstarter.appvars.<appname>_network_mode: ""` must be included and default to blank.
      - `com.dockstarter.appvars.<appname>_<var_name>: "<var_value>"` one entry for each variable specific to the app environment. See existing apps for examples
    - `logging` and the items beneath it should be included exactly as shown in other apps
    - `restart` should be `unless-stopped` or should include a comment about why another option is used
    - `volumes` should contain the volumes used by the app
      - `- /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro` is always included
      - `- ${DOCKERCONFDIR}/<appname>:<container_config>` should be used to define the primary config directory for the app
      - `- ${DOCKERSTORAGEDIR}:/storage` is always included
  - `<appname>.hostname.yml` sets the hostname to use the `${DOCKERHOSTNAME}` variable
  - `<appname>.netmode.yml` contains the `<APPNAME>_NETWORK_MODE` variable
  - `<appname>.ports.yml` contains the ports used by the app or a [placeholder](https://github.com/GhostWriters/DockSTARTer/blob/master/compose/.reqs/r1.yml) file if no ports are required
  - At least one of the following files must be included:
    - `<appname>.aarch64.yml` defines the aarch64 or arm64 image
    - `<appname>.armv7l.yml` defines the armv7l or armhf image
    - `<appname>.x86_64.yml` defines the x86_64 image

## .env.example file

- Contains environment variables to be used in the YAML templates
- All variables should be UPPERCASE
- Variables are split into sections with a comment to indicate the section name.
- Sections should be in the following order
  - `# Global Settings`
  - `# VPN Settings`
  - `# END OF DEFAULT SETTINGS` should be the last non-blank line in the file and followed by a blank line. Variables for apps enabled by DS will be placed alphabetically beneath this like. Users may also define their own variables after this point in their .env file

We use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/GhostWriters/DockSTARTer/actions) to run [tests](https://github.com/GhostWriters/DockSTARTer/tree/master/.github/workflows) on the code in the repository. Code must pass tests run by GitHub Actions in order to merge to the `master` branch of the repository.
